# BMMashupShowcase

Requires CoreUI.

The mashup showcase extension makes it easier to select between open mashups.

It does so by providing a full-screen preview of all the open mashups.

Once it is installed, it can be invoked through the ⌘M (Ctrl+M on Windows) keyboard shortcut.

Additionally, it allows using ⌘S on any open tab to save the open entity.
